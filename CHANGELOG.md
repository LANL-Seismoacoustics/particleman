# Changelog

## 0.3.0

* The order of arguments to `particleman.plotting.NIP_filter_plots` has changed,
  such that filtered radial is required, but filtered vertical and transverse
  are optional.  This allows Love polarization to be plotted.
* The location of the radial and vertical tiles in
  `particleman.plotting.NIP_filter_plots` have been swapped.
